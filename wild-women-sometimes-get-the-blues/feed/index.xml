					<description><![CDATA[I think what you said was actually very reasonable. But, think about this, suppose you 
composed a catchier post title? I am not saying your 
content isn&#039;t good., however what if you added something to maybe grab a person&#039;s attention? 
I mean Wild Women Sometimes Get the Blues &#124; Notes on the wing is a little vanilla.
You ought to peek at Yahoo&#039;s front page 
and watch how they create news titles to get viewers interested.
You might add a related video or a related pic or two to get 
people interested about what you&#039;ve got to say. Just my opinion, 
it could make your posts a little bit more interesting.]]></description>
